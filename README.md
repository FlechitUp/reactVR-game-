# React VR GAME

VR-Sea emerged as a personal project to have fun in my free time. The structure of this game combines Cloud technologies with VR (react-VR). 
I started this project learning about react-native, like displaying 3D assets, then programming interaction with this assets, later display a portal to another world.
I uploaded some code and videos of my learning stage, it is available [here](https://github.com/FlechitUp/reactVR-game-.git/). 
About cloud technologies, nowadays I am designing the way of get points in the game and especially save important information of game environment into the cloud, in order to balance the use of power of both cloud service and mobile phone.
